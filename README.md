# Sleeping_Pattern_Predict_Project

수정중 

[Object] 
- Bio-signal Analysis from Wearable Device
- Developing an Application for Medecal Service

[Contents] 
- Developing a LSTM-CNN Model to Predicting Personalized Wake-up Time by Analysing Sleep Patterns
- Integrating IoT Dvices on the App to Operating in Conjunction with  User's Personlized Wake-up Time

[Program Languages] 
- Python, SQL

[Idea] 
The Sleeping Stages Cycle Order is divided as N1, N2, N3, N2, and REM
Each cycle lasts around 90–110 minutes

In This Project, Labled Sleeping Cycle by Four-Stages (Awake, REM, Core, Deep)
Detecting Awake Time is labeld as "Core"

[Service]
- Service Title: Lite-Right
- Polit Web: (On going) by Streamlit
- App : (On going) by Swift, Xcode
